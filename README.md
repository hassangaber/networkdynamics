# GoServe
General web server for user display and file serving in golang.

## Running GoServe

1) If you do not have Golang installed, visit https://golang.org/doc/install and install it.

2) If you do not have git installed, type in the following in a bash terminal:

```
$ brew install git
```

3) After that, clone the repository to your machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PartialDifferentials/GoServe
```

Next, open the directory on your terminal by typing in:

```
$ cd GoServe/Server
```

Now, you are officially in GoServe.

 ## Running Diagnostic Tools
 ### Part I
 1) If Golang is not installed, please visit https://golang.org/doc/install and install it.
 2) I am assuming you have git installed on your machine, if it is not, type in:
 
 ```
 $ brew install git
 ```
 
 3) After doing so, to install Diagnostic Tools, type in:
 
 ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/partialdifferentials/offset
 ```
 
 4) You should have the Golang enviroment setup on your machine at this stage. In order to run the IP tool, for example, type in:
 
 ```
 $ go run /Offset/src/Local_IP.go
 ```
 And it should run on your machine! This goes for any other file in the repository, just change the file name.
 
 These were the instructions for the Golang tools in the repository. There is another PHP part to the project. 
 ### Part II
